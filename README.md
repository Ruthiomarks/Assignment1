<p>I am originally from Liverpool in the UK. I decided to come to Australia for a working holiday in June 2009. After spending a few months in this county I decided that I could see myself living here for the foreseeable future, I decided to go fruit picking to give me an extra visa which then would give me further time to find a suitable job who would be willing to sponsor me to stay. <p>
<p>My background is quite varied. When I first finished school, I went on to study a diploma of Accounting back in Liverpool. I then moved into retail and become a franchise owner of a popular optometrist located in North Sydney. After 8/9 years I decided to sell my shares in the franchise and not being sure of what I wanted to do next I took a job in medical recruitment whilst I decided on a career path. <p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I think how far technology has come is fascinating. I read an article not so long ago from the New York times the article was originally written when the first television was being introduced. The article was basically slating the need for such a device and the people of New York will never use one as they are way too busy to do so. How wrong the article was. Not only has Television become a part of our daily lives, it is also outstanding how far even television viewing has come. 3D TV, virtual television, interactive and the list goes on. <p>
<p>My personal interest began when as previously mentioned I had decided to sell my shares in the franchise I owned. I immediately began looking for a new career. I wanted something exciting and ever evolving. Something where I would continually need to learn and adapt, whilst of course paying well. As I was researching various careers which would suite my criteria, the COVID 19 pandemic hit. I was as virtually every industry suffered. I noticed that the majority of anything to do technology seemed to boom. I also looked back at the rate of employment and job growth within this sector and was amazed at the phenomenal rate this had grown and was continuing to do so. <p>
<p>The only IT experience I have is very basic Microsoft office and excel. I also have experience with various POS systems within a retail environment. I will consider myself an absolute rookie when it comes to IT as my previous roles have never required me to do anything very technical apart from sending lots of emails, creating the odd letter and spreadsheet here and there. Therefore, I knew I needed training before I even attempted to find a job within the industry. <p>
<p>Due to working full time I needed a course which I would be able to do on evening and weekends. I began searching various university not only in Australia but across the world. I spoke to various student advisors and found RMIT to be the most friendly and helpful. I felt confident this University would be the best choice for me and enrolled the next day. <p>

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<p>After deciding upon a career in IT I also investigated what jobs there are. I immediately was interested in becoming an Ethical Hacker. An ethical Hackers job is to ensure a business or organisations computer systems are safe. As in the title of the job they are basically hired to hack into the company or organisations network as to identify where any weak areas or issues may lie. This role is known as penetration tester within Australia. <p>
<p>My father owns his own accountancy business. One day he was hacked, and the hacker took months and months’ worth of data he had been working on for various clients and demanded money in exchange. My father decided not to give in to these demands and as a result lost a lot of work. <p>
<p>When I read about the Ethical Hacker role, I immediately remembered what had happened and I would love the opportunity to help business/ organisations to be safe from these cyber criminals. <p>
<p>Average Pay: $100,000- $120,000<p>
<p>In order to become a Ethical Hacker you firstly would need a bachelors degree in IT, cybersecurity or engineering etc. Due to the level of responsibility of this role you would need to gain some relevant experience either in entry level IT roles or network admin etc. After a period of sometime most organisations would offer various programs where you would be able to gain certifications for ethical hacking fields. Once these steps have been completed you would then be able to be considered for a role. Normally companies looking for ethical hackers require 4+ years of experience once again due to the responsibility of the role. <p>
<p>Please see the following link for an example.<p>
<p>Senior Penetration Tester (based in Melbourne CBD) -<p>
<p>https://www.seek.com.au/Job/50418601/?cid=ios-share<p>
<p>As previously mentioned, my highest qualification is a Diploma in accountancy, nor do I possess any experience in computing apart from school level. This would not meet the criteria for this role. My Plan is to obtain a bachelor’s degree in IT once I have completed this course I plan on obtaining an entry level role which would provide a career path to further my knowledge and enable me to gain whether it be voluntary or paid in programs that lead to certifications in ethical hacking, security analysis, pen testing  and related fields. <p>

<p>The Big Five Personality Test <p>
<p>https://www.truity.com/personality-test/17315/test-results/26462251<p>
<p>Results:<p>
<p>-	Openness 52%<p>
<p>-	Conscientiousness 48%<p>
<p>-	Extraversion 77%<p>
<p>-	Agreeableness 79%<p>
<p>-	Neuroticism 40% <p>
<p>I think doing various personality tests can help you better understand yourself more. Also providing an explanation why doing things in certain ways in the past has not worked. You learn about your strengths and weaknesses. You can use this information to help you learn better. For example one of my learning results said I am a tactile learner, now I know this I know not to rely on sitting and just listening to a lecture I actually have to get my hands on things and give things ago. Without doing the learning style test I would not have known. <p>
<p>I think knowing these results will help in a team environment by helping you better understand other people. We all have different situations that we are going to perform best in and knowing this will help us take a back seat when necessary and when to excel. <p>
<p>This also is helpful when forming a team as in an ideal world you want the best of everything choosing people with opposing strengths and weaknesses for example, so the team is well rounded. This can also help ensure you do not have too many strong personalities wanting to take the lead and also too many people sitting back waiting for someone to make a decision. <p>
